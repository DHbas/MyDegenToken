 # My Degen Token

This repository is for the project assessment of the project of the 4th module of : solidity-avax-intermediate course of Metacrafters academy . The purpose of creating this to prove my learning and to showcase my skill as a solidity developer to the people.

## Description
An Ethereum-based ERC20 token smart contract developed using Solidity. This contract inherits functionalities from various OpenZeppelin contracts such as ERC20, Ownable, and ERC20Burnable.

## Challenge
To create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

Mint Tokens: Generate new tokens and assign them to specified addresses.
Check Balances: View token balances of any address in the system.
Transfer Tokens: Facilitate token transfers between addresses.
Burn Tokens: Allow users to permanently destroy (burn) their tokens.
Redeem Tokens: Enable users to redeem specific amounts of tokens based on their choice, with distinct redemption options available.

It's essential to connect the metamask wallet with Avalanche Fuji C-Chain Testnet and to add view transaction to: https://testnet.snowtrace.io to check the transaction on the block viewer of Avalance Platform.

## Getting Started
## Executing Program
Open Remix IDE and create the Smart Contract named " DegenToken.sol " and paste the smart contract code to it.
Connect Metamask to the Remix IDE with the testnet account having AVAX token for the gas fee.
Deploy the contract using " Avalanche Fuji C-Chain " account.
Copy the Deployed contract address and go to https://testnet.snowtrace.io
Search the coppied address in the search box it will show all the transaction blocks of that smart contract.
Check All the functionality of my smart contract.
