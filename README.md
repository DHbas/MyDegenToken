 # My Degen Token

This repository has been created for the project assessment within the 4th module of the Solidity-AVAX Intermediate course offered by Metacrafters Academy. Its primary aim is to demonstrate my learning progress and show my proficiency as a Solidity developer to others.

## Description
An Ethereum-based ERC20 token smart contract developed using Solidity. This contract inherits functionalities from various OpenZeppelin contracts such as ERC20, Ownable, and ERC20Burnable.

## Challenge
To create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:

1. Mint Tokens: Generate new tokens and assign them to specified addresses.
2. Check Balances: View token balances of any address in the system.
3. Transfer Tokens: Facilitate token transfers between addresses.
4. Burn Tokens: Allow users to permanently destroy (burn) their tokens.
5. Redeem Tokens: Enable users to redeem specific amounts of tokens based on their choice, with distinct redemption options available.

It's essential to connect the metamask wallet with Avalanche Fuji C-Chain Testnet and to add view transaction to: https://testnet.snowtrace.io to check the transaction on the block viewer of Avalance Platform.

## Getting Started
## Executing Program
1. Launch the Remix IDE and create a Smart Contract named "DegenToken.sol".
2. Paste the smart contract code into the IDE to define the contract's functionalities.
3. Connect your Metamask wallet to the Remix IDE using a testnet account containing AVAX tokens to cover gas fees.
4. Deploy the contract using the `Avalanche Fuji C-Chain` account.
5. Copy the deployed contract address for future reference.
6. Navigate to https://testnet.snowtrace.io and input the copied contract address into the search box.
7. Explore and examine all transaction blocks associated with the smart contract to ensure its functionalities and integrity.
